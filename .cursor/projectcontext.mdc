# Synthra — AI Browser & Learning Agent

Overview:
Synthra is a Chrome Extension + Backend agent that helps users summarize, highlight, research, and suggest follow-up resources while browsing. It works as a sidebar that automates multi-tab workflows, connects to Notion, and uses OpenAI for reasoning.

Core Features:
- Summarize current tab content (concise bullets).
- Highlight & explain key terms.
- Multi-tab research automation (compare pages, consolidate).
- Suggest follow-up resources for continued learning.
- Notion integration (save summaries, highlights).
- Sidebar UI (React + Tailwind).
- Secure backend API (FastAPI, never exposing keys).

Security:
- Keys stored only on backend (.env).
- HTTPS enforced in prod.
- CORS restricted to extension ID.

Compatibility:
- Chrome (Manifest V3).
- Backend (FastAPI).
- Notion API integration.
- Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash).

Tech Stack:
- Chrome Extension: Manifest V3, React + Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind
- Backend: FastAPI (Python), Google Gemini, Notion SDK, Pydantic
- Shared: JSON schemas for summaries/highlights
